Installation
************

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/aulasneo/tutor-contrib-pok

Usage
*****

.. code-block:: bash

    tutor plugins enable pok

After enabling the plugin, you must activate POK certificates by enabling the ``module_pok.enable`` waffle flag. By default, POK certificates are disabled until this flag is turned on. You can also set course or organization-specific overrides in the waffle flags configuration for more granular control.

Configuration
*************

The following settings can be configured in your Tutor environment:

- ``POK_API_KEY``: (Required) The API key for authenticating with the POK service. This key is used to validate requests between your Open edX instance and POK.
- ``POK_TEMPLATE_ID``: (Optional) The default template ID to use for certificates when no course-specific template is specified. If not set, you'll need to configure templates for each course individually.

Example configuration in ``config.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    POK_API_KEY: "your-api-key-here"
    POK_TEMPLATE_ID: "default-template-id"  # Optional
